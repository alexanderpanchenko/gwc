  \begin{itemize}
  	\item \textbf{Target word}, e.g. ``bank''.
  	
  	\pause 
  	
  	\item \textbf{Contexts} where the word occurs, e.g.: 
  	\begin{itemize}
  	\item ``river \textbf{bank} is a slope beside a body of water''
  	\item ``\textbf{bank} is a financial institution that accepts deposits''
  	\item ``Oh, the \textbf{bank} was robbed. They took about a million dollars.''
  	\item ``\textbf{bank} of Elbe is a good and popular hangout spot complete with good food and fun''
  	\end{itemize}
  	
  	\pause 
  	
  	\item You need to \textbf{{group} the contexts by senses}:
  	\begin{itemize}
  	\item \textcolor{Cerulean}{``river \textbf{bank} is a slope beside a body of water''}
  	\item \textcolor{Cerulean}{``\textbf{bank} of Elbe is a good and popular hangout spot complete with good food and fun''}
  	\item \alert{``\textbf{bank} is a financial institution that accepts deposits''}
  	\item \alert{``Oh, the \textbf{bank} was robbed. They took about a million dollars.''}
